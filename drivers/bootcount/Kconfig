config BOOTCOUNT_EXT
	bool "Boot counter on EXT filesystem"
	help
	  Add support for maintaining boot count in a file on an EXT
	  filesystem.

config BOOTCOUNT_ENV
	bool "Boot counter in environment"
	help
	  If no softreset save registers are found on the hardware
	  "bootcount" is stored in the environment. To prevent a
	  saveenv on all reboots, the environment variable
	  "upgrade_available" is used. If "upgrade_available" is
	  0, "bootcount" is always 0, if "upgrade_available" is
	  1 "bootcount" is incremented in the environment.
	  So the Userspace Application must set the "upgrade_available"
	  and "bootcount" variable to 0, if a boot was successfully.

config SYS_BOOTCOUNT_EXT_INTERFACE
	string "Interface on which to find boot counter EXT filesystem"
	default "mmc"

	  boot counter.

	depends on BOOTCOUNT_EXT
	help
	  Set the filename and path of the file used to store the boot counter.
